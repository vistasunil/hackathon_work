# tekton-pipeline-example

Want to create Kubernetes-native build & release pipelines with [Tekton](https://tekton.dev) and [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io)? Check out [Dzero Labs' blog post on Medium](https://medium.com/dzerolabs/using-tekton-and-argocd-to-set-up-a-kubernetes-native-build-release-pipeline-cf4f4d9972b0). We'll cover:

* Basic Tekton and ArgoCD terms and concepts
* A walkthrough of the changes you need to make to the example code, so you can run the pipeline on your own
* Set up and run the example pipeline
